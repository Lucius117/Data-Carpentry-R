```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include=TRUE,
                      echo = TRUE,
                      message = TRUE,
                      warning = TRUE
                      )
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is a paragraph in an R Markdown documnet.

Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
fit=lm(dist~speed,data=cars)
b=coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[2]`.




You can write code in languages other than R with R Markdown, e.g.

## Bash

```{bash}
ls *.Rmd
```

## Python

```{python}
x="hello, python world!"
print(x.split(" "))
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,],caption="A knitr kable.")
```

Markdown provides an easy way to make standard types of formatted text, like


- *italic*
- **bold**
- `code`
- [links](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- etc.

But did you know that you can also use R Markdown's markdown to make

- Latex equations, $E=mc^{2}$
- And bibliographies [@rmarkdown15].
